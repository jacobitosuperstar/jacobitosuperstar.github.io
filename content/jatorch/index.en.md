## **JaTorchC - PyTorch Recreation in C**

🔗 [View on Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/jacobitosuperstar/JaTorchC)

A learning project to deeply understand machine learning fundamentals by recreating PyTorch from scratch in C, with plans for a Python interface.

### **Project Vision**

JaTorchC aims to provide a hands-on understanding of:
- How automatic differentiation works under the hood
- Tensor operations and memory management
- Neural network building blocks from first principles
- The bridge between low-level C and high-level Python interfaces

### **Why This Project?**

Building a deep learning framework from scratch is one of the best ways to truly understand:
- How gradients flow through computational graphs
- Memory layout and optimization for tensor operations
- The design decisions behind popular frameworks like PyTorch
