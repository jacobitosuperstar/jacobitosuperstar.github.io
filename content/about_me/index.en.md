## **ABOUT ME**

Hello, My name is Jacobo, I am a mechanical engineer currently working as a
programmer.

I started my professional career as a Heavy Machinery mechanic, solving the
tasks that no other mechanic wanted to take, the operating failures by the lack
of compatibility between parts. That led me to a fascinating world of machine
programming and hacking. Loved the job, but having to live in really isolated
locations and the insecurity on those areas, pushed me to find something
different.

As I started my masters in Automation, I started to walk away of C and started
to play around more with Python, and I totally fall in love with modern
programming. Started to automate several parts of my job as a contractor for
the ITM, and got closer and closer with the programming world.

At some point I saw that continuing with my studies was not something that I
was really passionate of following and took a even deeper dive with
programming, which land me the few jobs that I have listed in the CV section.

I have had the pleasure to work with many different teams, in some I have been
a great addition and still have contact to this day, in other I was nothing
more than just a number, but in all of them I tried my hardest to solve as much
problems as possible, and to bring my self to the next level.

At the top of the page there are my socials and my mail in case you want to
contact me. Have a great day.
