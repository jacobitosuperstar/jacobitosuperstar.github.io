## HI, I'M MATEO

I'm a software engineer based in Medellín, Colombia. When I'm not designing
backend systems, you'll find me behind the wheel of a rally car, riding my
mountain bike or just walking my dogs. I built this site to write down and
document the technical challenges that I solved and personal stories that I
like to throw in from time to time. This site is written both in English and
Spanish, and if you're working on similar challenges or just want to discuss
programming topics, I'd love to hear from you.

high-performance, real-time systems with Python. Most of my success has come through the solution of complex
architectural challenges and process optimizations.

## BEYOND CODE

I started rallying in 2019 at the Rally Legends race that took place in Cali,
Colombia. After that I have been in sporadic rally events and
participations in Bogotá, Ibagué and Manizales. I have a Fiat Uno and competed
in the 1000CC category, and I also have a Suzuki Jimny that I love to throw
around gravel roads and explore the country.

Lately my itch for speed has been tamed by my bike. Currently learning to
control it more, but currently I can bomb down hills without dying in the attempt,
make the smallest J hops imaginable and land face first when doing endos in
proper gravel roads. Normally the go to objects for my travels were my
notebook, a pen and my water colors to experience differently the places I am
travelling to, but my bike has been adding its way into my travels.

This site started as a place to store my writings and as the time went on I
added posts where I describe some of the technical challenges that I have faced
at work till it also became a place to put my CV at a more personal level, and leave
LinkedIn as a full professional profile.
