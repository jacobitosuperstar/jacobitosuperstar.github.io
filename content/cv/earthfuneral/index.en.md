- Developed and maintained the platform’s backend using Django, adding new
  features and improving overall stability.

- Built a real-time data processing system with MQTT (pub/sub), WebSocket
  broadcasting, Redis caching, and asynchronous task execution with Celery,
  enabling the platform to handle high-volume sensor data.

- Implemented a multi-database architecture using PostgreSQL for transactional
  data and TimescaleDB for time-series storage, connected through a custom
  database router.

- Developed an alert-response system that detects equipment failures via MQTT,
  triggers automated actions through Celery, and sends immediate notifications
  to monitoring dashboards via WebSocket.

- Improved overall performance by optimizing queries, adding indexes, and using
  Redis to speed up frequent data access.
