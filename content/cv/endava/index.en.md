### LabelPC

Help develop and maintain code from the LabelPC application, which is a Point
Cloud labeler on which we identify the different rooms of a storing facility to
measure storage pallet capacity, area and volume.

My most notable accomplishments on the project have been:

* Setting up the code documentation with Sphinx, and publishing the website in
Read the Docs.
* Create a custom Box Cloud tool to integrate the general use Box SDK to our
custom needs.
* Create automation workflows through the use of a server to automatically
generate and update the DXF files that represent each labeled facility.
* Introduce multi core utilization for the point cloud calculations and
filtering.
