### Math Engine

Helped develop a math engine for Quote Sizing and Investment Analysis in Real
State Loans. My main contributions for the project where:

- Creating automatic test generation through the use of test JSON files that
contained the different testing scenarios.

- Multi-objective or optimization space binary search to find the maximum loan
amount and the minimum net operating income for a desired loan amount.

Open Source version of the package in [Go][1]

### Point Cloud

Developed and maintained a desktop program for annotating point clouds through
a graphical interface. My main contributions to the project where:

- Creating and leading the implementation of an event driven architecture for
calculation heavy functionalities, where I diverted the load of the functions
to other cores from the computer through the use of multiprocessing, and other
optimizations at the object creation to diminish the impact on RAM consumption.

- Automating the creation of blueprints and other technical drawings from the
point cloud, through the use of a local server, that handled the updates or
changes of the annotated shapes within the Point Cloud.

- Creating a facade for the BOX Cloud SDK, to handle safely multi-threading and
simplifying functionality to our file updates and uploads.
