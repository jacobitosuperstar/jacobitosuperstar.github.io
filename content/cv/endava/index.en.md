### LabelPC

Developed the LabelPC application, which is a Point Cloud labeler on which we
identify the different rooms of a storing facility to measure storage pallet
capacity, area and volume.

My most notable accomplishments on the project have been:

* Setting up the code documentation with Sphinx, and publishing the website in
  our custom READ_THE_DOCS page.
* Create automation workflows through the use of a server to automatically
  generate and update the corresponding DXF files of the labeled facilities.
* Create a searchable file database through the creation of custom Box Cloud
  features in the SDK.
* Introduce multi core utilization for the point cloud calculations and
  filtering.
* Introduce event driven architecture within the application to maximize the
  resources being used within the users computer and increase loading speeds,
  add automatic features like autosave, background calculations updates, and
  others.

### Loan Sizing

Creating a custom web based tool to automate the loan sizing of different
products in multifamily Real State financing.
