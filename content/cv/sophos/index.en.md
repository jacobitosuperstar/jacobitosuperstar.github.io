#### Accomplishments

**Monitoring Platform for a Mine**
Because there was a communication gap between the Spanish speaking team, that
started the platform and the English speaking team that was going to continue
developing it, my role at the beginning was to be a communication bridge
between the Spanish talking team members and the English speaking team members
on a technical level. Because of it, we were able to understand and document
the base code and fix the infrastructure problems that we were having with
Kubernetes and deliver the needed results to the client.

My short time with the team was caused by a surgery my father was going to have
and my attention was required 100%. They did offered me paid vacation leave or
half day work so that I could stay with my father and not quit, but wasn't able
to accept because wasn't sure of the amount of time I was going to be away.
