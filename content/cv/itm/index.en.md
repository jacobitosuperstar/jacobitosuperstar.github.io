#### Accomplishments

Create a web portal that keeps track of all the students associated with
scholarships financed by the city of Medellín. It also  generated early alarms
indicating low performance in their grades and possible desertion from the
university, for the Well being department of the university.

Create an indicator for the quality of education of the university that
measures if the university turned a good student in an excellent student, an
excellent student to a great student, a bad student to a good student, and so
on. The idea was to measure the quality of the studies and the probability of
the upwards mobility of the student given the results.
