### University Indicators and Academic Monitoring Platform

I did miscellaneous work regarding student retention in the institution, on
which two of my more notable developments where

* Create a web portal that monitors all the students who are beneficiaries of
the scholarships awarded by the Medellín mayor's office, in order to generate
early alarms indicating low academic performance and possible desertion, for
the intervention of the university welfare department.

* Create an indicator that measures the impact of the university in a student,
measuring if the university turned a bad student into a good one, a good
student into an excellent one, and what happens with the already excellent
students that the university has.
