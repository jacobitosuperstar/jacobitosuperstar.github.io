### LaunchMobility Backend Platform

Had no achievements and couldn't do anything notable within the platform of the
company. Culture shock with the company. My way of work wasn't a match and I
felt that changing my way of doing things to fulfill the company's needs
required a great effort that was only useful in that place and time, but not
for my overall development as a programmer. Bummer, but that happens. Sometimes
you don't mesh with the team.

Did a kick-ass test exam tho. Micro services connecting different functionality
of the test application using both, messaging and endpoints within the docker
compose.
