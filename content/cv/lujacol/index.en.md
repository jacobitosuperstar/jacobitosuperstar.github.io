**Company Internal Tools**

Create a web portal for my clients to create orders, keep track of the shipping
status and download required documents for merchandise nationalization. This a
long with automatic emails for reminders and important notes about the
merchandise helps me keep the head count short on the company, prepare the
container in less than a week, and to work as lean as possible, minimizing
expenses.
