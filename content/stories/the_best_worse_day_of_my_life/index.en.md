There she was, a woman of unparalleled beauty, speaking words I wanted to hear
with a sweet tone, her fixed, flirtatious gaze making me feel just the way I
wanted. The combination of these traits and her gentle facial expressions make
life's optimistic proposals feel achievable.

Her name is Daniela. She invited my close friend, Andrés, and me to spend the
night on a mountain near the town. We would sit around a bonfire with her and
two of her friends. As I listened, a mental image of that promising night
formed. I could feel the warmth of the fire, hear laughter in endless
conversations, and my sight dazzled by fire, moon, and flashes of immortalizing
cameras.

After her proposal, her big brown eyes focused on me, imposing a slight smile
on my face. I couldn't hide my happiness and deep commitment to making it
happen. I would finally grasp that chalice holding something I've always
lacked, just out of reach. In the best case, I could only brush it with my
fingertips before facing divine punishment for attempting to take it.

Isabel, an equally close friend, has an uncertain relationship with Andrés,
understood by only those who grasp its complexity. Initially, we visited
Isabel, but Daniela's presence shifted our priorities entirely.

The promise of happiness didn't last long. Isabel's pensive yet mischievous
smile and her sweet voice, a symphony that captivates my ears, dissipate all
mental images of that potential future. "They have to leave," she told Daniela.
"Better for them to go quickly when traffic is not an issue."

I tried hard, arguing with Isabel, fighting for that future, a moment only
seconds away from realization. Although destiny had already ruled, I wanted
more now that everything felt so... Andrés, placing his hand on my shoulder,
made me realize that fighting was futile; it's time to leave.

As we got into the car, Daniela said challengingly, "You know where we'll be if
you want to come." Maybe she truly wanted us there, knowing this invitation,
this specific plan, was exactly what we'd been waiting for all our lives.

Those words repeat in my mind as I silently observe the road. Andrés,
uncomfortable with the silence, makes head gestures, unsure of what to say or
do. He knows, as well as I do, that opportunities like this come too seldom,
too few to reject. Breaking the silence is impossible; both of us are deeply
defeated.

A teacher once told me that to speak well, one must write well. Words spoken a
certain way can mean more than intended. In this case, Daniela's words
transformed a perfect weekend into a lost opportunity, something more that
could have been but wasn't. They weren't promises of love or sex; it was
something much more profound—an opportunity to grasp that divine chalice and
taste its contents, that distant, missing something in my soul, that prevents
me from being truly happy.

I cannot blame anyone—neither Daniela for giving me hope, nor Isabel for taking
it away, nor Andrés for resigning himself. I have boundless faith in life's
goodness and embrace the thought that if I didn't get to taste that divine
chalice on that specific day, perhaps one day I'll find a way to return to that
moment when it was within my reach. I'll immerse myself in the river of time,
swimming against its current until one day, finally...
