Friday 9:00 AM was the time she would leave for my house. I got up early, did
some cleaning and started showering. I had seen her on a page where clients
evaluate the services of the prostitutes they hire. In her profile, in addition
to her personal information, she had several photos verified by the page and
previous clients. She had a photo of her feet in close-up, a photo of her knees
and back where the angle emphasizes her ass and her feet, a photo of her lying
on her side on her bed naked in full body with a mask on and depending on the
ad that she is showing, one last photo of her full body in front of a mirror
showing her face and her naked body. “I have many additional services that you
can take, but all with a condom” said the title of the ad, with “NO ANAL,
NOTHING NATURAL, DO NOT INSIST” in capital letters at the end.

“I'm going to be late, it's raining and I'm barely going out,” is the message
that reaches me. She had contacted her the previous week in order to arrange a
service on a Saturday night, but she had to cancel. It wasn't that bad, because
of the inconvenience caused by her, she sent me a video of her naked
masturbating and told me that if I took a service with her in the future, she
would give me a good discount. We had short conversations over the next week,
in which she kept emphasizing how excited she was to finally meet me. I know
she says it because she has to be like that, flirtatious, she felt good the
sensation of talking to someone new, who wanted to spend time with me.

I didn't fall asleep, I just got lost in my thoughts while she looked at the
ceiling lying next to the window. I don't know what she was thinking, I just
know that she came back to me when I hear her ask for me at the goal and my
cell phone starts ringing. I went down to tell him where to park the
motorcycle. She was wearing a GAP sweatshirt and a Nike sweatshirt, both black,
with military green and gray New Balance sneakers. It seemed strange to me at
first, but it had earrings, a chain and a ring, all gold. It wasn't until we
went up to my apartment and she started talking to me about her belief in the
golden opportunity that it all made sense to me. They were magical objects,
they had a deeper meaning, they were the answer to a deep desire.

“What a beautiful house you have,” he tells me, “I don't plan to be in this all
my life, the idea is to stay for two years and I'm already in my second
year.” “Do you have any plans for the future,” I ask him. "I'm saving as much
as I can, I just know that I want to have my own company, I don't want to be
anyone's employee again," she answers. He looks at my living room while she
takes off her shoes. There is something to admire in a person who has the
ability to fully commit to her aspirations, something to celebrate in the
fruits of her hard work. As we shared our stories for a while, I could notice
that she began to look at her cell phone and that transitory enchanted moment
in which I can do nothing but contemplate the aesthetics of dreams, end.

“It's time for you to answer some questions before we start having sex,” she
told me. She had not finished overcoming the discomfort that that statement
caused me and she was already in her underwear waiting for me and my answers to
begin. “Do you have a particular fetish? Do you like something done to you
before sex? What do you like to do to women before sex? If the sex is good, do
you have a problem with us making some videos?” My answers were very insipid to
be honest, I'm sure I didn't generate anything additional to pity, but it
doesn't matter, she can have all the pity she wants for me.

Everything turned out well in the end, I can't say that there isn't some pain
in being intimate with a person for whom I am not someone else in a long list
of clients and false suitors. As I give her one last sweet kiss and watch her
leave, I can't stop thinking. The pain of my past has killed all the sacred
things I believed in, including love, and in the shadow of it, nothing is real.
So I'm afraid, that even if I have the things I want in that golden future that
awaits me, because of the things I lost, I will never experience true
happiness. And because she understands me, as no one else understands me, there
will never be love between us, since there is no action or emotion that will
eliminate the evil she has experienced. We have nothing left but to fight to
wake up from this nightmare, only to relive it again and again.
