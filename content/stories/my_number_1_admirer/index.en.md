In the morning, two Facebook notifications, one text message, and a friend
request came to my phone. "I really liked your stories," said the message, both
the message and the friend request came from the same person. Curious, I
accepted and checked their photos, hoping it wasn't a fake profile. To my
surprise, it was a beautiful woman with alluring swimsuit pictures, but that
had nothing to do with my exhaustive review.

Sitting on her bed, she lazily lay with her back turned after waking up. I
picked up her guitar and asked, "Mind if I play some music?." "Never," she
quickly replied, "but, it's raining now and I want to hear the rain for a
while." She said while clumsily moving the guitar away to rest her head on my
lap. I gently placed the guitar on the floor, gazing at her for a while, not
long after I woke up. I was still sitting there, with the pictures of what
seemed to be a admirer on my phone's screen. I had dreamt of that afternoon, a
past moment I longed to relive.

After noon, a new message arrived: "Thanks for accepting me, can I ask you
something?" Unable to resist a little smille comes from me, and I couldn't do
anything but to embrace that hope. My plan was to start a conversation from
that question, that would intertwine our lives, and like that relive those
distant memories, reaching that something, that essence of my lost soul in the
past.

"Ask away!" I replied immediately. "I'm working on an internet marketing
project and looking for people..."

I didn't bother reading the rest or continuing the conversation. I looked at
her profile photos one last time, imagining her inviting me for a Sunday
afternoon swim while wearing one of those provocative swimsuits. As I removed
her from my friends' list, I wondered what hope I could have when the memories
I wanted to relive were part of a dream that the destiny enjoys watching me
fail to fulfill?. It is cruel, it lets me graze it my fingertips before
pulling it back from me just enought to be out of my reach.

I gently touched her cheek, the rain drowns out those words and strange noises
she makes while asleep. Her room's walls are light blue and the carpet is dark
blue. She told me that she decorated the room like that to appear to be
sleeping peacefully in the middle of the ocean. I looked away from her, and the
guitar seemed to float away in water. As it vanished on the horizon, I woke up,
on my way to visit her.

When I visit, I clean a bit and place fresh flowers, her favorites, a sunflower
and a tulip. She used to play with their petals. Sometimes I lay on the marble
slab, telling her everything since our last talk. Other times, I get lost in
time, rushing out because I'm late. I always leave uneasy, feeling bad, I never
ask about how her love life is going...
