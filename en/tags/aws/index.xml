At least that was the challenge that I encountered while developing a file
classification web service. Mid development cycle management changed cloud
provider because of some juicy Azure discounts and the all so great office 365
integration that everyone loves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because of this, the compromise reached to be able to continue at the same
development speed and still lower the cloud services bill, was to continue to
work on AWS in the web service, but the files, after finished the process, must
be transferred to Azure.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
